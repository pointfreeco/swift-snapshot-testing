Delightful Swift snapshot testing.

## Usage

Once [installed](#installation), no additional configuration is required. You can import the `SnapshotTesting` module and call the `assert` function when using Swift Testing.

```swift
import SnapshotTesting

@MainActor
final class MyViewControllerTests: XCTestCase {
    func testMyViewController() async throws {
        let vc = MyViewController()
        try await assert(of: vc, as: .image)
    }
}
```

> When an assertion runs for the first time, a snapshot is automatically recorded to disk, and the test will fail, printing the file path of the newly recorded reference.

> Repeat test runs will load this reference and compare it with the runtime value. If they don't match, the test will fail and describe the difference.

You can record a new reference by customizing snapshots inline with the assertion or using the `withTestingEnvironment` method.

## Snapshot Anything

SnapshotTesting isn't limited to `UIView`s and `UIViewController`s. You can snapshot test any value on any Swift platform!

```swift
try await assert(of: user, as: .json)
try await assert(of: user, as: .plist)
try await assert(of: user, as: .customDump)
```

## Documentation

The latest documentation is available for both main components of the framework:

- For **XCSnapshotTesting** (the core snapshot testing functionality):
  [XCSnapshotTesting Documentation](https://swiftpackageindex.com/pointfreeco/swift-snapshot-testing/main/documentation/xcsnapshottesting)

- For **SnapshotTesting** (the Swift Testing integration and utilities):
  [SnapshotTesting Documentation](https://swiftpackageindex.com/pointfreeco/swift-snapshot-testing/main/documentation/snapshottesting)

These documents provide detailed information on how to use each component effectively in your testing workflows.

## Installation

### Xcode

1. From the **File** menu, navigate to **Swift Packages** and select **Add Package Dependencyâ€¦**.
2. Enter the package repository URL: `https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-snapshot-testing`.
3. Confirm the version and let Xcode resolve the package.
4. Ensure SnapshotTesting is added to a test target.

### Swift Package Manager

Add the package as a dependency in `Package.swift`:

```swift
dependencies: [
  .package(
    url: "https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-snapshot-testing",
    from: "2.0.0"
  ),
]
```

Next, add `SnapshotTesting` to your test target:

```swift
targets: [
  .testTarget(
    name: "MyAppTests",
    dependencies: [
      "MyApp",
      .product(name: "SnapshotTesting", package: "swift-snapshot-testing"),
    ]
  )
]
```

## Features

- **Versatile Snapshot Strategies**: Test any value, not just UI components.
- **Custom Snapshot Strategies**: Create your own snapshot strategies.
- **No Configuration Required**: Snapshots are saved alongside your tests automatically.
- **Device-Agnostic Snapshots**: Render views for specific devices from a single simulator.
- **Xcode Integration**: Image differences are captured as XCTest attachments.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Supports iOS, macOS, tvOS, and more.
- **SceneKit, SpriteKit, and WebKit Support**: Test these specialized views.
- **Codable Support**: Snapshot encodable data structures into JSON and property list representations.
- **Custom Diff Tool Integration**: Configure failure messages to print diff commands for tools like Kaleidoscope.

## Related Tools

- [`iOSSnapshotTestCase`](https://github.com/uber/ios-snapshot-test-case/) helped introduce screen
    shot testing to a broad audience in the iOS community. Experience with it inspired the creation
    of this library.

- [Jest](https://jestjs.io) brought generalized snapshot testing to the JavaScript community with
  a polished user experience. Several features of this library (diffing, automatically capturing
  new snapshots) were directly influenced.

SnapshotTesting was designed with [witness-oriented programming](https://www.pointfree.co/episodes/ep39-witness-oriented-library-design).

This concept (and more) are explored thoroughly in a series of episodes on
[Point-Free](https://www.pointfree.co), a video series exploring functional programming and Swift
hosted by [Brandon Williams](https://twitter.com/mbrandonw) and
[Stephen Celis](https://twitter.com/stephencelis).
