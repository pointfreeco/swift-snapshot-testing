# Migration guides

Learn how to upgrade your application to the newest version of this library.

## Overview

This library is under constant development, and we are always looking for ways to simplify the 
library, and make it more powerful. As such, we often need to deprecate certain APIs in favor of 
newer ones. We recommend people update their code as quickly as possible to the newest APIs, and 
these guides contain tips to do so.

> Important: Before following any particular migration guide be sure you have followed all the 
> preceding migration guides.
